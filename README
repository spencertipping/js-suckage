JS Suckage: A small script to catch obvious suckage in Javascript code.

Usage:
$ ./suckage file1.js file2.js ...

MIT license as usual.

Note that its output should be taken with a grain of salt. It might claim that
your code has suckage, but that doesn't mean it does. (It complains about
Caterwaul, for instance, but we all know it's perfect ;) )
